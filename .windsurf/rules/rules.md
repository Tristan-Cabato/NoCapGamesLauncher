# Don't overcomplicate anything
# This means no random class creation, no random imports outside of what's already implemented, no dependency testing, no system level modifications. Keep it simple, and follow what I'm doing
# No spamming of debug. "Let's add some debug prints," stop that, it's just bloating, not error handling, I know what points of the code hits an error, I don't need a line by line print error
